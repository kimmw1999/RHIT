# This file summarizes the differences between METHODS and FUNCTIONS.
#
# Methods and functions are the SAME in that:
#
#   1. They give a NAME to a block of code.
#
#   2. They are defined by using a DEF statement, e.g.:
#
#       def draw_dragon(color, size):
#           ...
#
#   3. They can have PARAMETERS that receive values from actual ARGUMENTS
#       when the method/function is CALLED.
#
# Methods and functions are DIFFERENT in that:
#
#   1. METHODs are associated with instances of CLASSES,
#        but FUNCTIONS have no such association.
#
#   2. The notation for calling a FUNCTION is:
#        function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)
#      e.g.
#        foo(3, "green")
#
#      The notation for calling a METHOD is:
#         object.method_name(argument1, argument2, ...)
#
#      where the object that precedes the DOT must be
#      an instance of the class with which the method is associated, e.g.
#        boris.forward(100)
#      where   boris    is an instance of the SimpleTurtle class
#      and     forward  is a method associated with the SimpleTurtle class.
